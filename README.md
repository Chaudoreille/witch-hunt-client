# üßôüèª Witch Hunt

Witch hunt was developed within 1.5 weeks as the final project for the [Ironhack](https://www.ironhack.com/) web development bootcamp.

## About the game

Witch Hunt is our take on social deduction games like Werewolf and Mafia.

## How to play

After creating an account on the website, you can create a game or sign up for one of the existing ones that have not started yet. Once the owner(creator) of a game room starts the game, every member of the game will be assigned a role - either a Witch or a torch-wielding Villager. The roles are hidden from other players.

The game is played in two phases - Daytime and Nighttime.

The Village is infested with bloodthirsty witches conducting evil Sabbaths to curse and kill villagers.

The goal for the witches is to kill all the villagers and make it a sage haven for witches.
The goal for the villagers is to find and lynch all the witches.

There are four different roles:
- The witches
- The villagers
- The little Girl (specialized villager)
- The priest (specialized villager)

During the day, everyone in the village will be able to debate in the village chat over who deserves to by lynched. In addition, every member of the village will be able to vote for one person. You can indicate your intention to vote for a person by clicking on their card. Once you are certain that you made the right choice, you can lock your vote.

After all votes have been counted, if there is a majority of votes against a player, that player will be lynched (they are dead and cannot participate in the game any longer). If there is a tie, no one dies. Then, the Night begins.

During the night, the chat is deactivated. Players cannot communicate, as they are either asleep or sneaking around. 

Every role but the sleeping villagers can take a specific action during the night.
- Witches can see other Witch players (if any). They hold a Sabbath and take a vote. They can see other witch's votes as during a villager's vote. The player getting the majority of votes dies, and the day begins. Again, in the case of a tie, no one dies.
- The little girl cannot take an action, but she also doesn't sleep. By hiding and peeking, she can see who the witches are!
- The Priest can pray before going to bed and bless one player. The player is protected from evil curses and will not die if the witches vote to kill him.

The day/night cycle continues until either all Villagers or all Witches have been killed off, the team that still has at least one member left alive will be the winning team.
