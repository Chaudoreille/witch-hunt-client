# Witch Hunt

Witch hunt was developed within 1.5 weeks as the final project for the [Ironhack](https://www.ironhack.com/) web development bootcamp.

## About the game

Witch Hunt is our take on social deduction games like Werewolf and Mafia.

## How to play

After creating an account on the website, you can create a game or sign up for one of the existing ones that have not started yet. Once the owner(creator) of a game room starts the game, every member of the game will be assigned a role - either a Witch or a torch-wielding Villager. The roles are hidden from other players.

The game is played in two phases - Daytime and Nighttime. During the day, everyone in the village will be able to chat in the village chat. In addition, every member of the village will be able to vote for one person to be lynched.

You can indicate your intention to vote for a person by clicking on their card. Once you are certain that you made the right choice, you can lock your vote.

After all votes have been counted, if there is a clear winner of the vote, that person will be killed off (they cannot participate in the game any longer), and the Night begins. If there is a tie, no one dies, and the Night begins with the same amount of players as the previous round,

During the night, Witches can see which other players are also a Witch (if any), and they will be able to vote again. They will not be able to talk in the chat, but they can see who the other Witches are voting for (and whether their vote is locked in yet or not). After all witches have voted, the person with the most votes is killed off, and the day begins. Again, in the case of a tie, no one dies.

The day/night cycle continues until either all Villagers or all Witches have been killed off, the team that still has a member left alive will be the winning team.
